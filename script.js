// Build a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions.
// App must run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML
// and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

// Must be clean and polished user interface and responsive.  Ensuring
// it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

// ***************** User Story **************
// Timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
// so I can gauge my progress compared to my peers



// Click a start button
// Use code from Password Generator homework assignment here to create button on page







// Start a timer and present the first question


     // While timer is ticking off need a condition to check for valid answers and for incorrect answers 
     // need to interrupt while loop to else (wrong answer) condition and decrement timer value variable by
     // 10000 milliseconds 




// Answer the question then present another question




// Create "Question Bank" of questions to present to user store them in an array that can be traversed randomly to
// ask user a question.

var arrQuestions = ["Question1", "Question2", "Question3", "Question4", "Question5", "Question6", "Question7", "Question8", "Question9", "Question10"];


// Question 1 = Commonly used data types DO NOT include:


// Question 2 = The condition in an if / else statement is enclosed within_.

// Question 3 = Arrays in JavaScript can be used to store:

// Question 4 = String values must be enclosed within_____ when being assigned to variables.

// Question 5 = A very useful tool used during development and debugging for printing content to the debugger is:

// *********************************
// Final Screen is:

// All Done!
// Your final score is 22.
// Enter your initials:    
// Submit button
// *********************************



// Create answer array of correct answers and map it's index to the corresponding question it answers correctly.



var arrAnswers = ["Answer1", "Answer2", "Answer3", "Answer4", "Answer5", "Answer6", "Answer7", "Answer8", "Answer9", "Answer10"];


// Storage of user responses

var userAnswer;











// If question answered in correctly
// Subtract time from the clock -- take off 10 seconds from timer

// See While loop above





// When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0



// The game is over


// When the game is over allow user to save initials and score.

var userInitials
var userScore
var topScore  // for comparison of scores
